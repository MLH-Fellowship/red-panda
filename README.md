# red-panda


Red pandas are endangered. Not closely related to your usual pandas, red pandas are found only in isolated mountainous areas in the high forests of Asia.
Because their populations are fragmented, itâ€™s difficult to know for sure how many red pandas there are, but the WWF estimates there are fewer than 10,000 left in the wild.

Due to a tragic loss of habitat, Yuki is one of the three remaining red pandas in the neighborhood. He hasn't met his partner Shishi in a while either,
and has been feeling lonely for a long time now. The gamer's goal is to help it reach its lover Shishi on the other end.

Having encountered various dangers throughout life, Yuki is easily suspicious and fearful.
To make him feel accommodated, safe and understood, you can feed him bamboo and learn more about him.

The purpose of the game is to make the gamer familiar with the consequences of human misadventures in not only our own habitats but also in those belonging to others.
Through building a warm, nurturing relationship with the panda, the gamer shall foster a sense of friendship and empathy for other species. They will learn about how
various enemies - that represent real-life threats to red pandas - have caused the pandas to be endangered, and about how they can help while there is still time.
